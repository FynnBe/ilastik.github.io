      ilastik  is a simple, user-friendly tool for <b>interactive image classification, 
      segmentation and analysis</b>. It is built as a modular software framework, which allows 
	  for <a href="http://github.com/ilastik/volumina">interactive visualization</a> and processing of very large datasets in 
	  <em>up to 5 dimensions</em>. 
	  Most analysis operations are performed <a href="http://github.com/ilastik/lazyflow">lazily</a>, which enables targeted interactive 
      processing of data subvolumes, followed by complete volume analysis in offline batch mode. Using it
      requires no experience in image processing.

    <p>
      ilastik is developed jointly by the group of Prof. Fred Hamprecht in the 
      <a href="http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de">Heidelberg Collaboratory 
      for Image Processing</a> and the <a href="http://www.janelia.org">
      HHMI Janelia Farm Research Campus</a>.

      ilastik has a convenient mouse interface for labeling an <em>arbitrary number
      of classes</em> in the images. These labels, along with a set of generic
      (nonlinear) image features, are then used to train a Random Forest classifier.
      In the <em>interactive training</em> mode, ilastik provides real-time feedback of
      the current classifier predictions and thus allows for targeted training and
      overall reduced labeling time. In addition, an uncertainty measure can guide
      the user to ambiguous regions of the data. Once the classifier has been trained
      on a representative subset of the data, it can be exported and used to
      <em>automatically process</em> a very large number of images.
    </p>

      The features are computed in the <em>full 2D/3D/4D pixel neighborhoods</em>,
      depending on the available data. While the provided set of features includes
      popular color, edge and texture descriptors, the <em>plug-in functionality</em>
      allows advanced users to add their own problem-specific features. Feature
      computation and classifier prediction are <em>multi-threaded</em> and fully
      exploit modern multi-core machines. 
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, we have used ilastik successfully on applications from the
      neurosciences (segmentation of EM images), systems biology (high throughput
      screening experiments) and industrial quality control.
